The shell scripts will need to be added to your path. For me I placed them in the directory ~/.local/bin.
All of these addons are publicly available on Github. The changes I made were mainly to their styling to change colours. 
The Arch wiki does a really good job documenting how to configure them. I mainly used that for troubleshooting.
