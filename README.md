The shell scripts will need to be added to your path. I placed them in the directory ~/.local/bin.
Configuring Hyprland is incredibly easy. I pretty much used only the Hyprland wiki and everything was good.

Everything used is on Github so go to their repos to figure out more details for configurations. 
While I made a few changes, the changes I made were mainly to their styling to change colours.
